That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. ",

    "description": "Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes.",

A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff",

First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18.",

Never was that more true than when he secured his place in English cricket history with an indefatigable batting display in the 2019 World Cup final. In making an unbeaten 84 he exhausted every ounce of strength, talent and willpower and then when he imagined it might be all over he came out to bat once more to help win a Super Over by the narrowest of margins.",

He made a century on ODI debut against UAE in 2015 having flown 20 hours following exams in New Zealand, but soon decided to throw his lot in with New Zealand and focused on his career with Auckland. His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy. He also bowls part-time left-arm spin which he has been encouraged to continue to work on. As a teenager he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing rugby in New Zealand but it did not stall his cricket career.\nESPNcricinfo staff",
